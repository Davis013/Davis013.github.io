                    <p>
                        Technical Specs: This application was designed using Android Studio, using Java as the programming language <br>
                    <br> Purpose of the Project: The purpose of the project was to design a mobile application for the Android platform that
                     would allow the user to access the application (Student Term Tracker) and keep track of their current term information such
                      as (Term name, classes in term, and information for the classes I.E tests, papers, tasks.) The application also allows the 
                      user to add new term information to the application, as well as classes and the required course curriculum information. There 
                      is a validation check in place to ensure that the user cannot delete any terms that have courses assigned to them. The application 
                      allows for notifications to come through when the application is closed, alerting the user that a course or specific task has begun 
                      or end depending on the start or end date of the course or task. To enable notifications for the courses or tasks the option notify 
                      course or notify task must be selected on the Add/Edit Course Information or Add/Edit Assessment Information. If the option has not 
                      been selected then the user will not recieve notifications to their device.

                    <h2>Appointment Scheduler Manager</h2>
                    <p>Technical Specs: This project uses Java as the Programming language, SceneBuilder for the GUI elements, and MySQL for database storage. <br>
                    <br>Purpose of the project: The purpose of the project was to create an appointment scheduler application that will allow the user to add
                     customer to the database, edit their information, or delete them from the database as well as add new appointments to the database, edit 
                     exisiting appointments in the database, or delete appointments entirely. This application can also generate reports based off specific queries
                      in the code, in the application there are currently 4 but can be changed to include more depending on the need. The 4 different reports that 
                      can be generated are the Total by Month, Total by Type, Contact Schedule, and Appointment by Country. This application is also protected by 
                      username and password protection, if the user does not enter the correct password or username they will not be able to access the application. 
                      (Username and Passwords are in the SQL database in a table listed Users) The application also includes a login activity log that displays the 
                      login attempts, the dates they were attempted, the time zone, time and whether the attempt was a fail or not. This application also allows for 
                      the login screen of the application to be displayed in a different language based on the preferred language on the users computer (The current 
                      langauges accepted are English and French)</p>
